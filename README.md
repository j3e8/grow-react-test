# usage

Clone the repo, then do
`npm i`
`npm i http-server -g`
`http-server`
Then, in a browser, visit http://localhost:8080/www/index.html

The whoismyrepresentative API should be running on http://localhost:3000 for the app to connect

## notes
* Rather than spend extra time setting up mobX or some other state machine for the one API request, I just used native JS
* I haven't set up webpack before. I spent a couple hours fussing with it so I could get JSX to transpile, but I never got SCSS to cooperate. I ended up adding Gulp to the project for SCSS compilation. Given more time, I'd hope to find a way to only use webpack.


# grow-react-test

For this programming test you are tasked with creating an interface around the open API located at http://whoismyrepresentative.com/api. However, to get around CORs limitation, we are providing an extremely simple node application that will act as a layer between your client app and the API. That application can be found at https://github.com/hillmanov/find-rep-api. Follow the instructions in that repoâ€™s README to get everything up and running. Once again,  you will be using that node app as your API - you will not be accessing whoismyrepresentative.com directly from your client side app. 

In your client side application, you will be making use of two of the endpoints that are offered: 

/representatives/:state
/senators/:state

Your application should allow the user to: 

Select if he/she would like to search by Representative or by Senator
Select which state to return results for
View a results list after #1 and #2 have been selected
Display name and party affiliation
View more information about the representative/senator by clicking on his/her name in the results list (district,  phone, office and a link to his/her website)

Your website should be built using Angular and match the provided design. 

Priorities: 

Functionality
Design
Code organization
Proper error handling (make sure they select something before clicking on the button to fetch results)

If you have any questions, please let us know.
