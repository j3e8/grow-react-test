  "description": "For this programming test you are tasked with creating an interface around the open API located at http://whoismyrepresentative.com/api. However, to get around CORs limitation, we are providing an extremely simple node application that will act as a layer between your client app and the API. That application can be found at https://github.com/hillmanov/find-rep-api. Follow the instructions in that repoâ€™s README to get everything up and running. Once again,  you will be using that node app as your API - you will not be accessing whoismyrepresentative.com directly from your client side app.",
